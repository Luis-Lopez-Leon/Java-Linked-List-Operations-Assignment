# Java-Linked-List-Operations-Assignment
Fall 2021 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms I Assignment 3

Target Topic: Linked List Operations

Here is the description of this two part assignment:

PART I: Word Game

Prompt the user for a string.

Dissect it into characters and build a SINGLE-ENDED SINGLY LINKED LIST out of them.
When we have a linked list of characters, we would like to implement the following rules:
1. Upon encountering a sequence of "rm" remove the character that follows this
sequence as well as "rm". In case it appears as the last segment of the word with no character
following it, just remove "rm".

2. No vowels should be in between consonants. In case you find such occurrence,
delete the vowel.

Here is an example: The first string is the original user input, the second is the result of one
round of implementation of the above rules and the third is the final version of the string after
complete elimination of illegal occurrences:

coppermakerimprint

cppkrmprnt

cppkrnt

As you notice you may need to reapply the rules to make sure that the final version of the string
complies with our rules. So you keep going over the linked list as many times as needed until the
string does not violate any of the above rules. For our example here, it took 2 rounds of
"scanning" to get to the final product.

You are required to display the current state of your linked list after completion of each round of
implementation of the rules, until the last one which is the final product of this game.

PART II: Numbers Game

Prompt the user for two sets of sorted numbers. You will first ask the number of items for the
first list and then read those numbers in a SINGLE-ENDED SINGLY LINKED LIST. You
repeat this process for the second linked list.

When you have your two sorted linked lists of integers. Write a segment of code to merge them
together into a single sorted linked list.

Next you must display the possible segments of duplicate values found in the merged list on
separate lines. In case there were not such occurrences, display a proper message.

Here is an example:

List 1: 3 4 6 11 11 19 24 24

List 2: 1 6 6 6 19 22 28 28 28 31

Merged List: 1 3 4 6 6 6 6 11 11 19 19 22 24 24 28 28 28 31

Sublists of duplicates:

6 6 6 6

11 11

19 19

24 24

28 28 28

No report is required for this assignment. Youâ€™re Welcome!
